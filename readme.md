gm_loadfunc
===========

A Garry's Mod module for obtaining pointers to functions inside of modules (specially useful for loading Lua only modules).

Info
-------

Mac was not tested at all (sorry but I'm cheap and lazy).

If stuff starts erroring or fails to work, be sure to check the correct line endings (\n and such) are present in the files for each OS.

The required Garry's Mod headers to build modules are already included as externals. Thank me later. You might also find some useful stuff there.
